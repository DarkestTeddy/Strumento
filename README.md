# Strumento - CS:GO Trading Tool (Discord Bot)
Strumento is a Discord bot developed in Python that acts as a tool to fetch information in regards to tradeable items or "skins" in Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

Strumento has the following features:
* Fetch the data of a skin such as the type, name, wear, float and pattern index from an inspect url.
* Provide you with a screenshot of your skin, generated by https://csgo.gallery
* Fetch links to listings of your skin on the Steam Community Market and Bitskins.
* Fetches the median price of your skin from the Steam Community Market
* Display the stickers applied on your skin, along with their respect wear percentages.
* Provide various information in relation to the pattern/type of skin i.e Doppler phases. 

## Usage
Using Strumento is very straight forward, simply type +info following by your inspect url of your skin and the bot will fetch the respective data and output in the channel the command was executed in. 

Input Example:

`+screenshot steam://rungame/730/76561202255233023/+csgo_econ_action_preview%20S76561198336720751A152`


## Development Status
Strumento is no longer being developed, the bot was originally inspired by 'Apollo'. Apollo is a Discord bot that has similar features to Strumento; however, at the time of creation Apollo was more so a screen-shot tool rather then a trading tool. In the last few months Artemis, the creator of Apollo has made an abundance of updates including making the bot more trading-oriented rather then just a screenshot tool. Therefore, development of Strumento is at a pause since there is no need for it anymore. I highly suggest checking out Apollo in action on the [r/GlobalOffensiveTrade](https://gotradediscord.xyz/) discord server. 

I also made this bot when I was still realitvely new to the idea of making Discord bots so the code isn't very efficent, if in the future there becomes a need for this bot, I'll be sure to update it to follow professional formating.
