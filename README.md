# Strumento - CS:GO Trading Tool (Discord Bot)
Strumento is a Discord bot developed in Python that acts as a tool to fetch information in regards to tradeable items or "skins" in Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

Strumento has the following features:
* Fetch the data of a skin such as the type, name, wear, float and pattern index from an inspect url.
* Provide you with a screenshot of your skin, generated by https://csgo.gallery
* Fetch links to listings of your skin on the Steam Community Market and Bitskins.
* Fetches the median price of your skin from the Steam Community Market
* Display the stickers applied on your skin, along with their respect wear percentages.
* Provide various information in relation to the pattern/type of skin i.e Doppler phases. 

## Usage
Using Strumento is very straight forward, simply type +info following by your inspect url of your skin and the bot will fetch the respective data and output in the channel the command was executed in. 

Input Example:

`+screenshot steam://rungame/730/76561202255233023/+csgo_econ_action_preview%20S76561198336720751A152`


## Development
Strumento is actively being developed, day by day and is currently in the Beta testing phase. Once released, Strumento will be available for anyone to use via an Discord invite link.

I would like to kindly ask that if you host the bot yourself or make edits to it, please give credit where credit is due.
